# CeD-SuRE-SNP
Pipeline and scripts for the survey of regulatory elements and snps on coeliac disease


# Repo structure
The repo is sub-divided into two parts `analysis` representing the downstream analysis of the SuRE data and `pipeline` respresenting the pipeline used to convert the SuRE seqeuncing data to a usable format.


`analysis` is likely not of much use, as this mostly contains bespoke R and bash scripts to generate and analyze the data for the manuscript

`pipeline` should hopefully be re-usable, but a substantial ammount of tweaking is probably required to get everything to run in your compute enviroment. 

For more details on `pipeline` and `analysis`, please see the respective folders README,
